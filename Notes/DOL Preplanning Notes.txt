- you take over the body of a hero, they become your avatar
- personality traits are erased temporarily when you play as them
- you have deck builder stuff, resets every dungeon (get modifiers to this over time w/ story progression)
- game starts with you being discovered/freed/whatever, it's just a deck-builder to start. failing has you restart (you require a worshipper to thrive, and the one person who frees you is that until they die or you progress)
- heros are customizable except for legendaries (heros based off friends/possible kickstarter)
- if legendaries are based off kickstarter, in options you can select 0-5 legendaries you want to show up most commonly. alternatively, a checkbox for dev's favourites that's just my friendgroup
- as the game progresses, you go from just 1 hero (avatar) to hero + new cards -> both of those + party member (you pick one from 3 or something) -> etc -> eventually you get out and town can start being built
- when you pick the first party member, they're dead. you use a god power to revive them. this tells the player that later a dead party member can be revived if they die
- when a party member dies, they can be carried back to town, but it costs a lot of inventory space (or something. there is a sacrifice to be made if you want to save a favourite hero)
- town has things happen while you're off on an adventure (make the town feel more alive)
- heros can have relationships & families (option preferences for heros to prioritize other heros, npcs, or no preference). you as god can also force people into/out of relationships so the game can be customizable as you want
- gender & sexuality aren't listed anywhere for anyone, & perceived gender has no effect on relationships formed. "wants a partner" y/n, and "wants kids" y/n are character traits. if two heros match on kids, they might have one or more (intentionally vague how they do)
- likes & dislikes section for each hero?
- be a leader to your party members: focus target, everyone defend, protect <member>, everyone attack, etc
- party members have special abilities that get activated in different ways (etc charging, active on certain turns or conditions etc). they must be told to use these, but you'll be notified when they're ready. special abilities are generally as strong as 1 card
- town research option to have a higher chance of finding legendary heroes when recruiting


card thoughts:
- not just strike & defend: name the different strikes. right hook, roundhouse kick, quick jab, etc. allows for different styles of combat (more kicks? more punches? etc). defend cards can be parry, block, dodge, etc. basic names
- strike & defend cards depend on character, not deity. they're the starting cards when you become an avatar. other more powerful cards can be started with over tine w/ story progression
- card game mechanics to consider: card draw, energy cost & gain, card stealing, discarding, bloat cards, damage, block, status effects (needs its own subsection), alternate costs, alternate resource gain


party member thoughts:
- damage increase/decrease, automatic block gain, block increase/decrease, hp increase/decrease, special attack stuff (needs its own subsection), out of combat effects (needs its own subsection)
- stat increases can happen over time via dungeon rewards
- out of combat stuff: better hp gain on rest, chance to find secret passages/treasure/avoid combat/etc, certain events might be affected by personality traits?
- no negative traits, focus on positivity (or neutrality at minimum, traits with a trade-off are fine eg +1dmg/-1def)
- if your champion is killed, you swap with a party member of your choice. only a portion of your cards transfer to them, and the previous champion now counts as a dead party member. this allows you to champion zerg (3 extra lives) to finish off a boss if you're *so close*, and also lets you try and escape with the corpse of the original champion if you want to keep them
