- you take over the body of a hero, they become your avatar
- personality traits are erased temporarily when you play as them
- you have deck builder stuff, resets every dungeon (get modifiers to this over time w/ story progression)
- game starts with you being discovered/freed/whatever, it's just a deck-builder to start. failing has you restart (you require a worshipper to thrive, and the one person who frees you is that until they die or you progress)
- heros are customizable except for legendaries (heros based off friends/possible kickstarter)
- if legendaries are based off kickstarter, in options you can select 0-5 legendaries you want to show up most commonly. alternatively, a checkbox for dev's favourites that's just my friendgroup
- as the game progresses, you go from just 1 hero (avatar) to hero + new cards -> both of those + party member (you pick one from 3 or something) -> etc -> eventually you get out and town can start being built
- when you pick the first party member, they're dead. you use a god power to revive them. this tells the player that later a dead party member can be revived if they die
- when a party member dies, they can be carried back to town, but it costs a lot of inventory space (or something. there is a sacrifice to be made if you want to save a favourite hero)
- town has things happen while you're off on an adventure (make the town feel more alive)
- heros can have relationships & families (option preferences for heros to prioritize other heros, npcs, or no preference). you as god can also force people into/out of relationships so the game can be customizable as you want
- gender & sexuality aren't listed anywhere for anyone, & perceived gender has no effect on relationships formed. "wants a partner" y/n, and "wants kids" y/n are character traits. if two heros match on kids, they might have one or more (intentionally vague how they do)
- likes & dislikes section for each hero?
- be a leader to your party members: focus target, everyone defend, protect <member>, everyone attack, etc
- party members have special abilities that get activated in different ways (etc charging, active on certain turns or conditions etc). they must be told to use these, but you'll be notified when they're ready. special abilities are generally as strong as 1 card
- town research option to have a higher chance of finding legendary heroes when recruiting


card thoughts:
- not just strike & defend: name the different strikes. right hook, roundhouse kick, quick jab, etc. allows for different styles of combat (more kicks? more punches? etc). defend cards can be parry, block, dodge, etc. basic names
- strike & defend cards depend on character, not deity. they're the starting cards when you become an avatar. other more powerful cards can be started with over tine w/ story progression
- card game mechanics to consider: card draw, energy cost & gain, card stealing, discarding, bloat cards, damage, block, status effects (needs its own subsection), alternate costs, alternate resource gain


party member thoughts:
- damage increase/decrease, automatic block gain, block increase/decrease, hp increase/decrease, special attack stuff (needs its own subsection), out of combat effects (needs its own subsection)
- stat increases can happen over time via dungeon rewards
- out of combat stuff: better hp gain on rest, chance to find secret passages/treasure/avoid combat/etc, certain events might be affected by personality traits?
- no negative traits, focus on positivity (or neutrality at minimum, traits with a trade-off are fine eg +1dmg/-1def)
- if your champion is killed, you swap with a party member of your choice. only a portion of your cards transfer to them, and the previous champion now counts as a dead party member. this allows you to champion zerg (3 extra lives) to finish off a boss if you're *so close*, and also lets you try and escape with the corpse of the original champion if you want to keep them


inventory thoughts:
- potions like in StS
- out-of-combat tools to change outcomes of events (darkest dungeon/StS events that depend on relics/good thing I have my trusty...!/etc)
- corpses take lots of space (dead champion/party member/maybe even finding someone on the way you might want to resurrect, which could have a higher chance of legendary or whatever)


hero thoughts:
- as mentioned above, legendaries that are my friend group/possible kickstarter if that ever happens
- if a hero completes an adventure alive & without being champion at any point, they gain something (incentive to bring favourites, despite the risk) - maybe points towards buffs/stats/etc?
- the above allows for adding corpses in dungeons that you might be incentivized to carry home despite inventory space; they could have better buffs/stats/etc


dungeon layout thoughts:
- dungeons have 1-n floors, with easier dungeons having less floors
- rather than in StS where you must go up, a dungeon map allows you to travel in the four cardinal directions, discovering rooms as you go (unless you have something that reveals the map)
- dungeons have a grid map, with connectors displaying access to the next room (or nothing in the case of no access)
- traversing to a previously-cleared room will usually do nothing. sometimes, random encounters show up
- random encounters won't offer any rewards, slightly discouraging trying to clear the whole map if you find the stairs to the next floor
- entering a room scouts all the next rooms in a straight from each exit, so you can see what's in them (combat, treasure, event, etc). this is only for free connectors
- connector ideas:
	- free connectors. just a connector, no special icon with it. you can both scout & travel in that direction. these are the most common connectors
	- simple closed doors. you can travel that direction no problem, but you can't scout it before going in. who knows what it'll be on the other side?
	- exclamation mark, signifying danger, along with an item icon and % chance of damage taken if you travel through it without the shown item. doesn't block scouting
	- locked doors. you can neither scout nor travel in that direction without a key, found somewhere on the floor of the dungeon. these are likely rare and only in difficult dungeons
